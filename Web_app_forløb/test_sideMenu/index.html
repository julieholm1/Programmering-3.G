        <p>Hello, friends! My name is Aly Beck. I love coffee, chocolate, and have a knack for procrastinating. 
          I currently reside in the lovely land of Ope (The Midwest) with my hubs and two tiny humans. 
          Where I got started: Many don't know this, but my biggest writing inspiration was my great Aunt S. At the age of 39, she started her writing career and by the age of 96 (yeah, 96) she published her final book before passing away. For years, I wanted to be just like her. And we'll, on November 10th of 2021, I made that dream come true with my debut, Web of Lies.But even before that, my dream started on Wattpad, where I published my very first books (they're still there. Horribly written, but there.) This writing journey has been so rewarding and has brought me here, to all of you.
