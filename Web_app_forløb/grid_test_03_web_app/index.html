          <p>Hello, friends! My name is Aly Beck. I love coffee, chocolate, and have a knack for procrastinating. 
            I currently reside in the lovely land of Ope (The Midwest) with my hubs and two tiny humans. 
            Where I got started: Many don't know this, but my biggest writing inspiration was my great Aunt S. At the age of 39, she started her writing career and by the age of 96 (yeah, 96) she published her final book before passing away. For years, I wanted to be just like her. And we'll, on November 10th of 2021, I made that dream come true with my debut, Web of Lies.But even before that, my dream started on Wattpad, where I published my very first books (they're still there. Horribly written, but there.) This writing journey has been so rewarding and has brought me here, to all of you.

            <p>Long before the world bowed down to the band Whispered Words. They shattered me to pieces when they walked away.Now, after five years apart, they're back to fix what they broke.If I let them...Before our fall—Callum, Rad, Kieran, and Asher—were mine. My everything. My rock stars. My future.Until they weren't.All it took was one night. One massive lie. One false accusation. And they were gone. Leaving me with a broken heart, a restraining order, and a baby on the way.After being presented with a new job and an inheritance, I move on with my life and build an empire of my own.But there's more to my life than meets the eye.A stranger lurks in the shadows, stalking my every move. Planning nefarious things, I can't even comprehend.And then there's them….The four boys who broke my heart. They're back in my life in the most unexpected way.But I'm not the girl they once knew. I'm their band manager now. Their boss for the next six months.Can we survive?One by one, our secrets crumble to ashes. Confessions shatter us, and lies become irreparable truths.My name is River West, and this is the story of how Whispered Words broke my heart, repaired it, and made me whole.</p>

          <p>"I adored this second half of River’s story. It is easily worth more than five stars. I cannot even begin to put into words how much I loved the duet. Book one broke me, and book two was everything I needed to rebuild my heart."</p>
          <p>"Wow! This was an incredible ending to wrap up this fantastic duet which was full of angsty heartbreaking drama. I’ve felt joy, frustration and sadness and everything in between."</p>
          <p>"OMG what a rollercoaster this made me laugh cry and fall in love with certain characters. The conclusion to the story was amazing."</p>
