        <p>Hello, friends! My name is Aly Beck. I love coffee, chocolate, and have a knack for procrastinating. 
          I currently reside in the lovely land of Ope (The Midwest) with my hubs and two tiny humans. 
          Where I got started: Many don't know this, but my biggest writing inspiration was my great Aunt S. At the age of 39, she started her writing career and by the age of 96 (yeah, 96) she published her final book before passing away. For years, I wanted to be just like her. And we'll, on November 10th of 2021, I made that dream come true with my debut, Web of Lies.But even before that, my dream started on Wattpad, where I published my very first books (they're still there. Horribly written, but there.) This writing journey has been so rewarding and has brought me here, to all of you.

        <h3>Resume</h3>
        <p>Long before the world bowed down to the band Whispered Words, they bowed down to me. I was a simple girl in a small town, working two jobs and juggling college full-time—all in the name of a better future. Until them...Kieran. Cal. Ash. Rad. They marched into my world like a hurricane, infiltrating every aspect of my life and taking control until they owned every inch of me. I became their obsession. Their toy to use. And I ate up every second of it. Looking back, I should have run in the opposite direction the moment they mentioned my family name. West. I should have known they were only chasing me for my father, Corbin West's multi-million-dollar music legacy. But I didn't. I stayed. I loved. And then I was wrecked. Every fortified wall I erected, they beat down until I was left in shambles, and then they shattered me to pieces. Music. Lies. Love. Betrayal. Money. Rock and roll. It all amounted to a whirlwind romance full of deceptive destruction and betrayal. My name is River West, and this is the story of how Whispered Words loved me, used me, and tore my heart in two, leaving me when I needed them most.

        <p>“Sometimes you know you’re going to love a book from the opening line. And this was one of those rare occasions for me. From the very first sentence, I was hooked. I couldn’t put it down.”</p>
        <p>“I *inhaled* this book. I have no other words for it. From the very beginning, I was hooked and I had to drag myself away to do the adult things I should be doing instead.”</p>
        <p>“This book was phenomenal! Hands down, one of the best books for 2022!”</p>

        <p>"I adored this second half of River’s story. It is easily worth more than five stars. I cannot even begin to put into words how much I loved the duet. Book one broke me, and book two was everything I needed to rebuild my heart."</p>
        <p>"Wow! This was an incredible ending to wrap up this fantastic duet which was full of angsty heartbreaking drama. I’ve felt joy, frustration and sadness and everything in between."</p>
        <p>"OMG what a rollercoaster this made me laugh cry and fall in love with certain characters. The conclusion to the story was amazing."</p>
